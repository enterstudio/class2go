            <p><strong>Class begins January 15, 2013</strong></p>
	    <p>This is an introductory course on databases, primarily focusing on how databases and database systems are used in applications. The course will cover relational databases and SQL as well as cover semi-structured and unstructured data using the XML and JSON models. It will cover different ways of designing databases and include such important topics such as; indexes, views, transactions, authorization, integrity, triggers, and online analytical processing (OLAP). Towards the end of the class, Cloud databases and NoSQL systems will also be covered.</p>

            <p><strong>Class began October 8, 2012</strong></p>
            <p>This is an introductory course on computer networking, specifically the Internet. It focuses on explaining how the Internet works, ranging from how bits are modulated on wires and in wireless to application-level protocols like BitTorrent and HTTP. It also explains the principles of how to design networks and network protocols. Students gain experience reading and understanding RFCs (Internet protocol specifications) as statements of what a system should do. The course grounds many of the concepts in current practice and recent developments, such as net neutrality and DNS security.</p>
